# TreasureChest
3D treasure chest using WebGL

This is a treasure chest model made with WebGL in a Interactive computer graphics course
taken at LSU.

1) Ensure that your browser is capable of running WebGL and supports "canvas"
   (I recommend Google Chrome)
2) Open up the file "Viewer.html" in your browser and you will be able to play with the model
3) Enjoy!
